# Bio


{{ image(url="me.jpeg", alt="Me", no_hover=true,start=true) }}

I'm currently a Channel Sales Engineer at Eagle Eye Networks, and a recent graduate of Purdue's inaugural Integrated Business & Engineering program with a Bachelor of Science.

I'm a builder at heart and enjoy working towards a vision with my own two hands, developing whatever skills necessary along the way.
