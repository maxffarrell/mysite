# Bio


{{ image(url="me.webp", alt="Me", no_hover=true,start=true) }}

I'm currently a Sales Engineer at Brivo, with a Bachelor of Science from Purdue's Integrated Business & Engineering program.

I'm a builder at heart and enjoy working towards a vision with my own two hands, developing whatever skills necessary along the way.
