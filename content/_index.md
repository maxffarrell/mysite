{{ image(url="me.webp", alt="Me", no_hover=true,start=true) }}

I'm currently a Sales Engineer at Zello, with a Bachelor of Science from Purdue's new Integrated Business & Engineering program.

I'm a fast learner and a hard worker, and I'm always looking to grow and learn. I'm passionate about blending technology with strategy to solve problems and make people's lives better.
