## I think I have a virus

Take a look at [Malwarebytes Free](https://malwarebytes.com) and run a scan.

If you want what's called "real-time protection," where it checks your computer in the background, you can get the Premium subscription, [frequently on sale](https://slickdeals.net/newsearch.php?searchtype=normal&isUserSearch=1&q=malwarebytes&pp=20&sort=newest&rating=1&forumid%5B%5D=9&forumid%5B%5D=30&forumid%5B%5D=25&forumid%5B%5D=10&forumid%5B%5D=38&forumid%5B%5D=54&forumid%5B%5D=13&forumid%5B%5D=4&forumid%5B%5D=8&forumid%5B%5D=39&forumid%5B%5D=53&forumid%5B%5D=177&forumid%5B%5D=41&forumid%5B%5D=44&forumid%5B%5D=166&r=1&hideexpired=1).

## My internet stinks

If it's good in some areas of your house but not others, it's probably related to your Wi-Fi coverage. Check with [speedtest.net](https://speedtest.net)

My go-to recommendation is a set of used [eeros](https://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_from=R40&_nkw=eero+j010001+3+pack&_sacat=0&_stpos=11697&_fcid=1&_sop=15) for around $50 

{% alert(warning=true) %}
Although these have been a great solution for some people, since they are sold through eBay, it is a good idea to:

1. Make sure they include power adapters
2. Look for a listing where seller offers returns
3. Pay with PayPal for a better chance of disputing if there is a problem

{% end %}

When setting up eeros, it's best to connect as many as possible to ethernet, but if this isn't possible, try to place the satellites (the eeros without wired ethernet connection) a maximum of one wall away from the gateway (the one with a wired ethernet connection).

If it's unreliable, working some days but not others, and you have Spectrum, it might be best to look into switching to Verizon.

## Do I need a new computer?

If your computer:

- is using a version of Windows older than Windows 10
- is an Intel Mac (pre-2020) with stuck keys or a broken screen

it's probably best to get a new one.

If you're running Windows 10, use [this app](https://aka.ms/GetPCHealthCheckApp) to see if your computer can be upgraded to Windows 11, since Windows 10 will stop receiving updates this October.

If budget is a concern, take a look at Ubuntu on YouTube and see if it could work for you. Installing it is a little tricky, but it runs much faster than Windows on older computers.

## Laptop recommendations

*(as of December 2024)*

- If your eyesight is a concern, go with 15" or larger (trust me!)
- If you want the best reliability and good battery life, I recommend the MacBook Air M2 with 16GB of RAM.
